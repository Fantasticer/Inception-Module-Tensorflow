# Implementation of Inception Module

Beside the comments in the code itself, I also wrote an article 
which you can find [here](https://mohitjain.me/2018/06/09/googlenet/) with further explanations on the Inception Module
and GoogLeNet.

## Content

- `inception.py`: Implementation of Inception Module
- `Inception Train & Test.ipynb`: Notebook to train and test the implementation of Inception Module.
- `layers`: Contains files implementing basic layers [convolutions, max pooling and fully connected]
